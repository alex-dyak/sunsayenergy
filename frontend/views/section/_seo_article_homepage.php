    Autonomous solar power stations: stable energy supply and obvious savings

    Autonomous solar power stations are a highly efficient alternative source of electricity. These power stations work
    by using sunlight, which is an endless natural source of energy, and turning it into the electricity we need for our
    everyday use.

    When does it make sense to consider installing an autonomous solar power station?

    A custom-made autonomous solar power station can solve multiple problems:

    Absence or distance from a regular power grid:
    If you don't have access to a traditional electricity grid or it's far away, an autonomous solar power station can
    provide reliable electricity during the day, ensuring your comfort.

    Frequent power outages:
    Traditional power grids often suffer from power supply interruptions, causing inconvenience. In contrast, autonomous
    solar power stations operate continuously without such interruptions. These stations are equipped with monitoring
    systems that detect and address minor malfunctions promptly, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted power supply.

    Insufficient power capacity of the power grid:
    If the power grid in your area has limited capacity and struggles to meet your energy needs, solar power stations
    with batteries can come to the rescue. These stations are designed to supplement your energy requirements, and with
    careful planning and system design, they can provide additional capacity as needed.

    Investing in a solar power station can lead to significant savings on utility bills and reduce dependence on rising
    tariffs. The cost of such stations depends on the number of solar panels and additional equipment. Typically, these
    eco-friendly systems cover their costs in around 5 years, providing energy independence and immediate benefits.


    You can purchase an independent solar power station for a private house, summer cottage, boarding house, hotel, or
    farm, which can cover a significant portion of your expenses over time. The only current drawback is the
    bureaucratic complexity of connecting these stations to the ""Green Tariff"" program. However, it is promised that
    this will change soon, making hybrid autonomous stations more advantageous.

    Principle of Operation of an Independent Solar Power Station

    An autonomous power station is customized and equipped based on an individual project, considering operating
    conditions and the required power specifications.

    The list of components includes:

    Solar panels.
    - Modules capture solar energy, convert it into electricity, and distribute it to power-consuming areas.
    - Polycrystalline or monocrystalline panels are installed on the southern side of the roof or another suitable
    surface and connected into a single chain. The frame is made of anodized aluminum, ensuring strength for at least 20
    years.

    Battery batteries.
    - Required for storing excess electricity generated during the day. These batteries activate at night or during
    adverse weather conditions when energy supply decreases.

    Charge controllers.
    - Special devices that optimize the electricity transfer process from the battery block and control battery
    charging. Controllers minimize possible losses, allowing the energy storage elements to continue working
    efficiently.

    Inverters.
    - Special equipment that serves multiple functions.
    - The primary inverter converts the direct current produced by the solar module block into alternating current with
    a voltage suitable for electrical equipment.
    - Additional inverters are connected to the batteries. The number of devices depends on the number of phases and the
    nominal load.

    You can purchase a complete autonomous solar power station with comprehensive services from SUNSAY NRG. Their
    experts, who have a deep understanding of alternative power supply, offer project support, from studying the
    features of the location to connecting a station that fully meets the client's needs.
